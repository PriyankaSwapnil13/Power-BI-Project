# Air Quality Index-Power-BI
This Air Quality Index (AQI) Dashboard provides real-time and historical insights into the air quality across various cities in India, using continuous date-wise sensor data. It tracks key pollutants and gases present in the atmosphere and helps assess the health impact of air quality levels.

Parameter	Description

PM2.5	Fine particulate matter (less than 2.5µm); harmful when inhaled deeply

PM10	Coarse dust particles (less than 10µm); contributes to smog and dust

CO (Carbon Monoxide)	Toxic gas from incomplete combustion (e.g., vehicle emissions)

CO₂ (Carbon Dioxide)	Common greenhouse gas; not directly toxic but related to pollution

NO (Nitric Oxide)	Indicates vehicle and industrial emissions; high levels = health risk

NO₂ (Nitric Dioxide)	A toxic form of nitrogen oxide; contributes to respiratory issues

NOx (Nitrogen Oxides)	Combination of NO and NO₂; overall indicator of combustion pollution

NH₃ (Ammonia)	Common in agricultural and waste emissions; eye and respiratory irritant

SO₂ (Sulfur Dioxide)	Emitted from burning fossil fuels; can cause lung disease

O₃ (Ozone)	Ground-level ozone; harmful to lungs despite being protective in upper atmosphere
